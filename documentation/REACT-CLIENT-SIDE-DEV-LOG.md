# Client Side Development Log

Use ReactJS as my frontend tool.

### Upgraded NPM to latest version (v7.5)
Windows:
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force
npm install -g npm-windows-upgrade
npm-windows-upgrade
```

### Create ReactJS App from project directory
```bash
npx create-react-application frontend
```
- You will see a frontend folder in your directory containing initial react files.
